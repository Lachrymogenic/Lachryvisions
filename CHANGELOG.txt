LachREVISIONS:
- Gold swords now do 6.5 damage after some consideration, reverted their durability.
    Changes to Gold Swords do not work in MultiMC because it cannot find the right field. So I've reverted balancing of Gold Swords for now
- Gamemode commands now work with command blocks.
- You can now right-click signs to edit them. Singleplayer only, for now.
- If you run out of space on a sign line, it will move you down to the next line.
- Horse Rearing chance has been raised from 1/4 to 1/1000 because it was too annoying.

Backported features:
- Backported /fill command from Et Futurum.
- Backported Mutton and an Item registration class from Et Futurum.
